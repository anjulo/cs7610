The provided Paxos consensus algorithm implementation presents a distributed system, utilizing a TCP-based communication for  reliable message passing between peers. 
The architecture assigns each peer a unique identifier maintains both incoming and outgoing tcp sockets for each peer, with message handling implemented using a dedicated listener thread, 
allowing for efficient non-blocking operations.

The protocol implementation follows classic Paxos algorithm from the lecture, with an approach to proposal number generation that combines round numbers 
and proposer IDs through bit manipulation. Messages contain three fields (message type, proposal number, and value). The majority-based consensus mechanism 
requires acknowledgment from more than half of the peers, while state transitions are managed through a series of message handlers.

Some design decisions are made and shape the system's behavior and limitations. 
    1. The four-bit constraint on round numbers and peer ID's creates a potential scalability bottleneck
    2. The lack of persistent storage for critical state information makes the system vulnerable to data loss during failures.
However, I beleive from usage standpoint, the implementation is functionally complete as it's not for use in production environment.
